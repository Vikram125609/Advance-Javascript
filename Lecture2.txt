When we run a javascript program a execution context is created

var n = 2;
function square (num) {
    return num * num;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);

execution context is created in two phases

first phase is the Memory creation
-> Javascript will allocate Memory to the variables and functions in the first phase 
and store them in the Memory component 

and store them as key values pair in the first phase 
n : undefined 
& for the function it stores the whole code of the function 
square2 : undefined
square4 : undefined 


second phase is the code execution
