Everything in javascript happen inside the execution context
It is like a big box and has two component in it 
First component is called Memory component and here all the variable and functions are stored as key values pair 
and the Memory component is also know as variable environment

and the second component is know as code component so this is the place where code is executed one line at a time 
and it also know as thread of execution

Javascript is a synchronus single-threaded language
